# Crop-recommendation-System
crop recommendation using ant colony optimization and Semi-supervised SVM
The aim of the project is to develop a crop recommendation model to predict the crop name based on the charactristics of the soil like(N,P,K,temperature, humidity, rainfall, ph) 
this 7 features are given as input to the ant-colony model to give the best features as output 
those best features are given as input for K-Means cluster, This model will cluster the data and then gicen to SVM model for the crop pridiction.
